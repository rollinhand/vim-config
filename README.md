# vim-config
my personal vim config

## Usage
The file `vim-plugins.sh` is used to install plugins from source with
VIM's integrated plugin manager (since version 8). No need for any sophisticated
plugin manager like Vundle or Pathogen.

It also installs some snippets from [vim-snippets](https://github.com/rollinhand/vim-snippets).

`.vimrc` is currently very small because I use only some plugins in their default installation
so they can be used on all important platforms.
